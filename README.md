# Data Analysis and Visualization 
## Dataset Introduction

- The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable -Outcome.
- Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age.

## Objective
The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. 
In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old (minimum age in the dataset).

## Methods
The dataset have nine columns(variables/attributes).

ðŸ“Œ Independent attributes are Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age.

ðŸ“Œ Dependent variable is Outcome.

### Data unbalanced
ðŸ“Œ Oversampling techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can be used for further analysis.

### Handling missing/null values
ðŸ“Œ The missing values '0' is replaced by the median of the variables for the analysis. As there are outliers in the data median is more robust than mean.

ðŸ“Œ Outliers below 1% only those rows are removed from the dataset.

## Libraries used in this analysis
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib.pyplot
- stats
  
ðŸ“Œ From the plots, can determine women having high Glucose levels and BMI levels tend to have Diabetes.
